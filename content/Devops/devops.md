# What is DevOps?

Basically, in the IT industry, software gets developed by the tech team, and this tech team has been subdivided between two sub-teams called the developer and the operation team. The job of the developer's team is to develop an application using codes, once the coding is done, it needs to be handed over to the operation team whose job is to deploy the application on to the server.

Both the team usually conflict with several issues such as design, testing, security, dependency, environment mismatch, and many more. Due to these problems, there was a lot of “to and fro” between the developer team and the operation team. These were the major problem, and this had to be solved, and these were solved using the concept of DevOps.

The software industry usually treats DevOps as a combination of the developer and operation. A DevOps is an idea that acts as a bridge between the software development and operation team. Usually, a DevOps engineer collaborates, integrates, and communicate among the development and operations department in the organization.  The primary role of a DevOps is constantly monitoring and automating every phase of the software development process. If we look at the lifecycle of DevOps, it resembles the infinity(∞) symbol.

It is a continuous process that starts with **Planning**, **Coding**, **Building**, **Testing**, **Releasing**, **Deploying**, **Operating**, and ends at **Monitoring**. These stages of the lifecycle are usually achieved with the help of [DevOps tools](https://geekflare.com/devops-tools/). Git, Jenkins, Splunk, Nagios, Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes are the list of top trending DevOps tools.
